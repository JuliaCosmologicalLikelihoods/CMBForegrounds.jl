`CMBForegrounds.jl` is a high-performance, differentiable Julia package for computing foreground components of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum.

This package is designed as a foundational toolkit for building CMB likelihoods. It is **agnostic** by design: no specific experimental templates are included. Instead, it provides the core spectral and spatial models, allowing users to construct likelihoods for various experiments by providing templates where necessary.

The core design principles are:
* üöÄ **Performance:** All functions are type-stable and optimized for speed.
* üß† **Differentiability:** The entire model pipeline is compatible with automatic differentiation (AD), enabling gradient-based parameter inference.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Modularity:** The functions are self-contained and can be easily composed to build complex foreground models.
